# Frontend Mentor - Audiophile e-commerce website solution

This is a solution to the [Audiophile e-commerce website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). This is my first project using Vuejs and learning about some of the key features such as components and how they communicate, Vue Router, VueX to name a few. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out an e-commerce website based off the Figma designs and get it looking as close to the designs as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
